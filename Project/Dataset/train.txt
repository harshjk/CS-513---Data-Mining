algorithm	0	You are given an array of words. from each word, you make a chain, in that, you remove one char at a time and you remove that char only when the remaining word is present in the input array. For Example, if the input is {a, b, ab, ac, aba} then the possible chains are from 'a', there is no chain, the chain it 'a' itself (of length 1) similarly, from 'b', the chain length is 1 one (length is defined by the number of words in the chain) now from 'ab', there are two possibilities which are ({ab -> b when you remove a},{ab -> a when you remove b}). So the max length is 2 here now from 'ac', we only have one possibility which is ({ac -> a when we remove c}), because, when we remove 'a', we left with 'c' which is not present in the input. Now, you have to find the length of the biggest such chain. Input: array of words Output: length of the biggest such chain.

algorithm	0	Delhi Route Traffic Optimizer  Traffic congestion is an annoying issue in Delhi, the capital of India. Every morning thousands of people drivea residential area to the International Technology Park (ITPL). There are various routes one can take to reach ITPL and each route takes its own time making some routes faster than the others. People obviously take faster routes which causes congestion on those roads too. Congestion results into increased travel time, air pollution and wastage of fuel. As a Traffic commissioner of Delhi, you are asked to optimize the traffic by putting toll to various roads so that resultant cost of every route (driving time cost and toll cost) ends up the same. This has to be done in such a way that any driver pays toll only once no matter which route he/she takes.roads have one-way traffic and there is no cycle in any of the routes. You need to create a toll plan for a given road layout.   The toll plan must adhere to following rules:  1. Toll should be levied in such a way that perceived cost (base road cost and toll cost) remains same forroads. 2. The tolls should be levied such that the total cost for each route is minimized. 3. A route cannot have more than one toll. 4. In case of multiple solutions for a route, add toll to a road that is closer to destination.  In some use cases, it might be impossible to impose tolls that satisfy the above conditions.  http://qa.geeksforgeeks.org/11340/delhi-route-traffic-optimizer

algorithm	0	There are two integer array arrayA and arrayB in the same size and two integer countA and countB. If arrayA[i] > arrayB[i], then we increase countA by 1, if arrayB[i]>arrayA[i], then we increase countB by 1. We will do nothing otherwise.

algorithm	0	You have a range of consecutive numbers, from 1 to n (inclusive). e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4... n]. We would like to calculate a sum of a function across the entire range, where the function returns the product of the preceding C elements.  If there are less than C previous elements, just use the available numbers. i.e. if you are processing the fourth number in the range, but C is greater than 3, then you will calculate the product using only the 3 available preceding numbers. In this situation as you move further along in this range more preceding numbers become available.  A worked example follows: if n=5 and C=2, the correct products and final sum for each element of the range are: 0 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 12 = 21  Can you explain this question and complexity of your algorithm?
algorithm	2	Early on I prefer to post the interview questions with a simplified description or only present the algorithmic part of it. Because it's hard for our students to memorize the full description of a problem. Therefore often times only the algorithm behind the question is given.  But somehow a user of this site @concernedCoder gets unhappy with it. So from today on, we will try to recover the original version of the question as much as possible.  We assure you all of the questions we posted are real  questions that you have a good chance to come across during a coding interview. Anyone who has experience in a coding interview should be able to see that.   Here is the full description of a recent Amazon OA question. The reason why we are able to provide the full description is because it's the online assessment. But for an on-site interview it's almost impossible to recover the questions perfectly.  Title: Item Recommendations Amazon wants to recommend items to a customer who has just made a purchase. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is based on item 'connection'. Two items are 'strongly connected' if a single customer bought both of them. Two items are 'weakly connected' if they are both strongly and weakly connected to some other third item.  Your  task is to determine the number of the items strongly and weakly connected to a given item.  You are provided the item id represented as a string, as well as the list of customer purchases represented as an array of strings. Each element in the array consists of a customer id(represented as a string) and an item id (also represented as a string). The two ids are separated by a colon. For example, if they element in the array is "ABJA:Z42G" then that means customer ABJA purchased item Z42G. Your output consists of an array, where the first element in the array represents the number of items strongly connected to the provided item id and the second element represents the number of items weakly connected to the provided item id. For example, if you were provided with the following input: determineRecommendation("ABC",["first:ABC", "first:HIJ", "sec:HIJ", "sec:KLM", "third:NOP", "fourth:ABC", "fourth:QRS", "first"DEF", "fifth:KLM", "fifth:TUV"])  You would return the following array: [3, 2] since ABC is strongly connected to 3 items: DEF, HIJ and QRS and is weakly connected to 2 items: KLM and TUV   Although the description is long, the problem is just asking for 'search (with either DFS or BFS) in a graph'.

algorithm	0	We tend to use computer to solve practical problems that actually earns or save dollars. Here is something that happens across the stock exchanges : people buy and sell stocks. We generally use automated intelligent systems to buy and sell stocks. That part is too much mathematics, and beyond scope of this interview. There is another part. Suppose the system issues a buy order : buy 1000 Microsoft stock. Now, there are more than 1 ( in fact 10 ) active exchanges from where we can buy MSFT.  There is a slight price delta, which keeps changing over time. There is another problem. In each stock exchange, prices are stacked, that is : 1. For first 100 stocks prices are 55$. 2. Next 200 stocks, prices are 55.2$. ... etc, and you got the idea. Even this stacks are changing over time.  Thus, here is the problem to solve. Design and implement a system such that one can buy  n stocks with minimal price. Also, in the same spirit, the same system should be able to sell n stocks with maximum payoff possible.  This is a non trivial problem, for Quant systems. There are always k no of exchanges to hit.

Observe that each Pi is nothing but [ xi, yi, zi ].  Once the initial condition is set, definitely gravity would work and they would start falling against each other. Write code to simulate this problem. Imagine G, the constant of gravity as 1.  How do you go about simulating it? Hint : feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_09.html see 9.5   Face to face. Pen and Paper.

If you failed to solve the question, and you do not try it  ( let it untouched ) , you would receive  0 marks. If you solve it wrong ( i.e. not the correct answer ) - you would receive -1 ( negative) . With the story, here are the problems:  1. Write an algorithm, which, given an input array ( set )  of questions, and varying probability ( 0 <= p <= 1 )  of can do and can not do per question, generates a strategy for solving the paper to generate maximum expected pay off.  2. Given the question paper is multiple choice, between 4 choices ( a,b,c,d )  do a bias analysis ( e.g. if more a's are coming than 'c's ), and decide if you would like to probabilistically take risk and mark some to increase pay off.  Obviously, you can get a maximum 40, and a minimum -20.  3. Now, put yourself in the position of the examiner, and try to ensure it is almost impossible to increase payoff by random selection over the questions. Try to negate the bias. That is question 3.  In all 3 cases write an algorithm. Face to face interview, time allocated was 60 minutes. Panel Interview.

algorithm	2	We define a subarray of array to be a contiguous block of a's elements having a length that is less than or equal to the length of array a. For example, the subarray of array a = [1,2,3] are [1], [2], [1,2], [2,3], and [1,2,3]. Now, let's say we have an integer, k = 3. The subarrays of a having elements that sum to a number <=k are [1], [2], and [1,2]. The longest of these subarrays is [1,2], which had a length of 2.  Complete the maxLength function in the editor. It has 2 parameters :   1. An array of integers, a.   2. An integer, k The function must return the length of the longest subarray elements that sum to a number less than or equal to k.  Input Format Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function: The first line contains a single ineteger n, denoting the number of elements in array a. Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <=i < n) contains an integer describing elements i in array a. Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i <= n) contains an integer describing elements i in array a. The last line contains an integer, k.

algorithm	0	You are currently in practice mode. This is a demo only.  A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. An equilibrium index of this array is any integer P such that 0  P < N and the sum of elements of lower indices is equal to the sum of elements of higher indices, i.e.  A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P1] = A[P+1] + ... + A[N2] + A[N1]. Sum of zero elements is assumed to be equal to 0. This can happen if P = 0 or if P = N1.  For example, consider the following array A consisting of N = 8 elements:    A[0] = -1   A[1] =  3   A[2] = -4   A[3] =  5   A[4] =  1   A[5] = -6   A[6] =  2   A[7] =  1 P = 1 is an equilibrium index of this array, because:  A[0] = 1 = A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5] + A[6] + A[7] P = 3 is an equilibrium index of this array, because:  A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = 2 = A[4] + A[5] + A[6] + A[7] P = 7 is also an equilibrium index, because:  A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5] + A[6] = 0 and there are no elements with indices greater than 7.  P = 8 is not an equilibrium index, because it does not fulfill the condition 0  P < N.  Write a function:  int solution(int A[], int N);  that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns any of its equilibrium indices. The function should return 1 if no equilibrium index exists.  For example, given array A shown above, the function may return 1, 3 or 7, as explained above.  Assume that:  N is an integer within the range [0..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]. Complexity:  expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.

algorithm	0	Stanford has to select a team of dodgeball players from its class of 2013. There are n students in the class and each student is identified by his/her student ID, which is between 1 and n. The coach has to select K players out of these n students for his team. But there is a twist, if among the K dodgeball players, a player's ID number evenly divides another player's ID number, then there is a high chance of them getting into a fight. The coach will do his best to select the K players so that no pair of players among them will want to fight one another. But if the game turns out to be very popular, this becomes impossible. Complete the function dodgeBall to return the minimum size of K at which it becomes impossible to choose a  dodgeball team that has no fighting?  Input Format: One line of text, containing the size of the class of 2013, n  Constraints: 1 <= n <= 5,000,000,000 n is guaranteed to be an even number  Output Format: The minimum size of K that guarantees the existence of 2 players who fight with each other in any K-sized subset of the class.  Sample Input: 4  Sample Output: 3  Explanation: If the team = {1,2,3}: 1&2 or 1&3 can fight with each other If the team = {1,3,4}: 1&3 or 1&4 can fight with each other If the team = {2,3,4}: 2&4 can fight with each other If K=2, then the teams {3,4} or {2,3} will have no fights. So 3 is the smallest value of K for which any K-sized team, must include a fighting pair.  Sample Input: 2  Sample Output: 2  Explanation: The team = {1,2}: 1&2 can fight with each other

algorithm	0	There is down-turn in the ship-building industry. Ace Shipping Corp (ASC) wants to be prepared by having a system that will help evaluate the total cost saving they will achieve if they were to let go some employees.  Following are the rules for drawing up this Firing List:  Each manager at every level in the organization will have to contribute heads from his team to the firing list  The input to the system would be a small integer k (=1,2, etc) which would be the number of employees chosen per manager. The output would be the total cost saved for this k. Different values of k would give an idea of the total cost saving achieved.  The primary selection criteria is Performance Rating. k employees with the minimum rating under a given manager are to be selected.  If two employees have the same rating, the one with the higher salary gets selected (to maximize cost saved)  The activity might be requested for the sub-org under any manager. The default is to consider the entire org.  Although total number of reportees for a manager is usually of the order of 10, it could possibly be a much larger number in some org too. An optimal way of choosing the k reportees would be preferred.  The following information needs to get stored per Employee:  Employee ID (unique)  Name  Performance Rating (1-5, 1 is lowest, 5 is highest)  Salary (Rs)

Sure, if you want. But there are a number of things we'd like to achieve:   The container will be in memory and will need to hold lots of data, so we'd like it to be as space  efficient as possible, but not to the extent where speed is significantly compromised. Speed is  king, memory/disk can be purchased.   Since we hate collecting garbage, we need to be careful about memory allocation during a query, as  my grandmother told me, "allocate not, gc not".   Code should be clear and understandable.   The rough order of trade off to consider for this case is: search performance, efficient  usage of memory, simplicity and maintainability of the code  These objectives are often at odds - we'd like to explore what's possible.
algorithm	0	Given an array of five integers that represents a poker hand e.g. [2,2,2,3,3] return the value of the hand, valid values are only "pair","two pairs","three of a kind","full house","four of a kind" we don't have to worry about straight, flush or straight flush.  My approach was to have a fixed array of 13 elements (each element represents one possible value of the hand) this array will keep the occurrence of each value of our hand and after we have all the values we just iterate this array and multiply all the values by itself and adding them to get a unique result.  For example if we have [2,2,3,4,5] our fixed array will have a "2" and three "1" so our result will be "2*2+1*1+1*1+1*1",the result will be 7, so all the possible hands will have unique values, if we find a 7 as a result we will know it is a pair, a 9 will be two pairs, a 11 will be three of a kind, 13 will be a full house and 17 will be a four of a kind.  This algorithm is O(1) both in complexity and space but the  interviewer didn't like it too much.
algorithm	0	Assume that garbage collector is not there in place or you are implementing a garbage collector for C++. Write the design and sample code for garbage collector implementation  We have 3 classed and Class A, B, C. object of A uses object B and Object of B uses Object of C. How can we track the object existence and clear memory ? Answer which I suggested : Write a tree (or Graph?)data structure (Garbage collector is a container class holds this data structure)  where each node has multiple paths to reach. If any of the node is not having a path to reach then we can clean that memory. This way the garbage collection will work. Please suggest your design as well.

algorithm	2	We have a long string. We label some substrings with tags.   - A tag entry is [startIndex, endIndex, tag]. - Query: 1 or more tags - Output: all blocks/ranges with all queried tags.  Example tag entries:      [23, 72, 0] // label [23, 72) with tag 0     [34, 53, 1] // label [34, 53) with tag 1     [100, 128, 0]  Query and Output:      0 => [23, 72], [100, 128]     0,1 => [34,53] // [34, 53) matches both tag 0 and 1  Give an efficient algorithm. Please describe your algorithm before posting code.  **Edit**: To add some difficulties, partial overlap is treated the same as full overlap, ONLY the overlapped part matches both tags. E.g. if we have entries:      [23, 72, 0] // label [23, 72) with tag 0     [10, 53, 1] // label [34, 53) with tag 1  Query and Output:     0,1 => [23,53] // [23, 53) matches both tag 0 and 1  Minor detials: Note in the comments we used open range on the right, i.e. if the string named "str", [23, 72, 0] includes str[23] but NOT str[72]; and there's no overlap between the following entries: [23, 72, 0] [10, 23, 0]

algorithm	0	You are given a rectangular grid with 2 rows and N columns. The top row is labeled 1 and the bottom row is labeled 2. The columns are labeled from 1 to N in increasing order. Each cell in the grid contains a single character. Consider a hamiltonian walk in this grid. Meaning, pick a starting cell, say (i,j), and consider a path that starts from (i,j) and goes through every cell in the grid exactly once. Note that you can only walk to adjacent cells, or cells that you share a common edge with. There may be several such paths. Let us concatenate the characters in the order in which the cells are visited during a walk. The string formed can be called the string for the walk. Among all the possible walks, and their respective strings, find out the lexicographically smallest string. We know that the length of the strings are all the same - to be precise, 2N. Thus, the lexicographically smallest string is simply the alphabetically smallest string if you compare the characters from left to right. Input The first line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. Then follow T test cases. Each test case contains 3 lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of columns in the grid. It is well known of course that the grid contains 2 rows. The next two lines contain the description of the grid in the form of two strings; the string of N characters in row 1 from left to right and the string of N characters in row 2 from left to right, respectively. Each character will be a lowercase english letter. Output Output a single line for each test case. The line must contain a string with 2N characters. This string should be the lexicographically smallest string for some hamiltonian walk in the grid. Constraints 1  T  100 1  N  10    Sample Input 2 3 abc def 10 ababaaabab bababababa    Sample Output abcfed aaababababababababab    Explanation In the first test the possible strings are { abcfed, adebcf, adefcb, badefc, bcfeda, cbadef, cfedab, cfebad, dabcfe, dabefc, defcba, edabcf, efcbad, fedabc, fcbade, fcbeda }. The smallest string is abcfed.

algorithm	0	The idea is their are "ticket stalls" with a certain number of tickets, say 9. Any ticket they sell is priced at the number of tickets that remain, so first ticket would be $9, second $8 etc...  You're given two lines of data, say:  2 4 1 5 The first row contains two numbers:  The number of stalls How many tickets are sold The second line contains a list of how many tickets each stall has initially, so in this case stall 1 has 1 ticket, stall 5 has 5 tickets.  The problem: what is the maximum amount of money you can make selling the given number of tickets?  In this case, you sell four tickets from stall two for a price of 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = $14

algorithm	0	Write a program that takes as its input an arbitrarily long sequence of words where each word has arbitrary length and is limited to the 26 characters (a-z).  The output of this program is a Boolean value for each input word.  TRUE if the word is an anagram of any of the previous inputs, and FALSE otherwise.  The program should read its input from a file of newline separated words and write its output to standard out.  The program should make efficient use of memory and perform well with large data sets.  Provide some test cases to demonstrate that the code works as expected.  Also, please provide a written explanation of your approach to the problem, your thought process in your choice of data structures and algorithms (including any choices you considered and rejected), design tradeoffs, and why you expect your design to perform well with very large data sets.  How does the memory footprint scale with the number of words and the word lengths? How does the response time scale with the number of words and word lengths? The answers to these scalability questions depend not only on the program design, but on the nature of the input sets.  Complete and precise treatments are a major undertaking, but take it as far as you can go.  If you make any simplifying assumptions about the input distributions, call them out.

algorithm	0	Design a electricity division system consisting of wires that pass through channels.  Bunch of wires is coming into a single large channel from the Huge pool of wires is divided to a set of smaller channels  the clasp(if open electricity can pass through channel else not) at the junction controls which smaller channels receive the electricity. Each smaller channel then divides the wires into even smaller channels  controlled by the clasp, and so on  till it reaches the destination nodes(homes/offices etc).  Develop an system and algorithm for "electricity division system " It is following constraints:   Each channel must have a minimum number of  wires Each channel can not receive more than a maximum number of wires If a channel does not need any electricity , wires going through that channel that would have gone towards the minimum number of that wires can be divided into other channels. 4.The channels pass through multiple types of resources. The restriction is that  channels that are blue must be given priority over channels those are red.   Is it possible to develop a system such that once the single large channel  divides wires to the 1st channel, the current never stops till it reaches the destination resource? If not, then why? If yes, then develop the algorithm and write the code for such a system.

algorithm	0	The King's Land Sale - 2 You might have seen shopkeepers offering sale on their trade items to promote their business - like sale on electronic gadgets or sale on clothing and accessories etc. But have you ever come across something like sale of land ?  Yes, the king of Byteland has grown old and wants to sell away his territory as soon as possible. So he announced a sale on his plot. This drew attention of many land lords and everybody hurried to buy land at the cheapest prices. The king had declared that he would accept bids of only rectangular plots and one needs to mention the diagonally opposite corners(a, b) and (c, d) of the land he wishes to buy. They would write these 4 numbers (a, b, c, d) on a piece of paper, seal it in an airtight envelope and give it to the king.  The king received N such envelopes. As the process was hidden there were many envelopes containing plot descriptions that shared some (or even all) common area. The king now wants to know the union of the areas of all plots that have come under the bidding.  Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.  Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.  Constraints  1  T  20  1  N  20  -10000  a, b, c, d  10000  Input  The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. The description of T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer N, the number of rectangular plots. Then N lines follow, each with 4 space separated integers, a b c d,(a, b) and (c, d) representing the diagonally opposite corners of the plots.  Output  For each test case print one line, the union of the areas of all the plots.    Explanation  1) The individual areas of both plots are 4 each. But they share a common area of 1 between them (between (1, 1) and (2, 2)). Therefore the total area is 4 + 4 - 1 = 7  2)Both the plots of no area in common. So we simply add their individual areas (6 + 9 = 15).

algorithm	0	Minimum number of jumps required to climb stairs  Its basically like, you have 2 parallel staircases and both the staircases have n steps. You start from the bottom and you may move upwards on either of the staircases. Each step on the staircase has a penalty attached to it. You can also move across both the staircases with some other penalty.  I had to find the minimum penalty that will be imposed for reaching the top.  I tried writing a recurrence relation but I couldn't write anything because of so many variables.  I recently read about dynamic programming and I think this question is related to that.  With some googling, I found that this question is the same as  https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/frost-byte-final/challenges/stairway  Can you please give a solution or an approach for this problem ?

algorithm	0	Problem Statement Given a stream of numbers, write code to calculate the rolling average and rolling maximum over two different window sizes. We provide an illustrative example below. It illustrates the expected output for window sizes of 3 and 5. For your solution please implement a solution that uses window sizes of 3 and 20. For example, given a stream containing the following values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] the following tuples would be expected, where None indicates that a value is not available, and would be NaN in some languages: (None, None, None, None)(None, None, None, None)(2, 3, None, None)(3, 4, None, None)(4, 5, 3, 5)(5, 6, 4, 6)  You should write a class which accepts an iterator and acts as a generator which yields tuples as shown above. C++ guidance This is a sample interface for C++; you may use any functionally equivalent interface that you wish. Your implementation would accept an InputStream reference and implement StatisticsGenerator. structStatistics { boolvalid;// true only if mean and max fields are valid doublemean; doublemax; }; classStatisticsGenerator { public: // Returns true if more elements are available boolHasNext(); // Get the current statistics. std::pair<Statistics, Statistics> GetNext(); }; classInputStream { public: // Returns true if more elements are available boolHasNext(); // Get the next element in the stream doubleGetNext(); };

algorithm	0	Maga gives a hard problem to Alex. And Alex couldn't solve yet. Could you help him?  The grid is n by m. Each cell contains a unique number on it. Maga is at the left-top and wants to go to right-bottom. But there is a condition. Maga can go through only two way - right and down. And the path of your move is called the nodes you have passed through over them. The path is called the most beautiful if the following condition is satisfied: The sorted of the path has to be lexicographic smallest as possible as. Output the most beautiful path for given grid.  Input: In the first line you are given two numbers: the dimensions of grid - n and m. The next n lines contains m numbers. Each number is unique.  Output: Output the most beautiful path.  Contraints: 1 <= n,m <= 1000 1 <= A[i][j] <= n*m, All of the numbers in the grid are unique.   Sample Input 2 2 4 2 3 1  Sample Output 1 2 4  Explanation There are 2 ways to reach at (2,2) cell. The pathes are 4, 3, 1 or 4, 2, 1 respectively. So The most beautiful of them is 4, 2, 1 because if looking the sorted of them it looks like these : 1, 3, 4 and 1, 2, 4 respectively. So 1, 2, 4 is lexicographic smaller than the other. So the ans is 1 2 4.
algorithm	0	Little Chandan is a friend everyone feels lucky to have. He is a happy-go-lucky-fellow and makes sure that everyone around him is happy. But recently, he came to know that his friend little Arjit is in serious trouble, and needs help. Like the great friend little Chandan is, he took the challenge upon himself without any serious thought, to make sure that little Arjit feels fine.  Now, little Arjit explains the story of his problems (His life, in general!) to let little Chandan figure out his troubles. After all, everyone needs help. All little Arjit needs is to get an internship somewhere, and complete his dual degree course, somehow, anyhow.  Little Chandan being the great genius man with psychic power decides to enter the brain of his friend to help him out.  Here are the contents of little Arjit's brain: - His goals. (Internship, dual degree, remember?) - what Chandan needs to free. - Predictable empty spaces in his brain - plain empty spaces. - Ex-girlfriends and their memories - which CANNOT be penetrated, while traversing. - Windows which lead to the goal - which need to be open for little Chandan to pass.  Little Chandan knows the location of the two goals in his brain, the problem is while traveling through the path of his brain he'll have to break down the windows - once he has opened a window to cross that path, it remains open forever. So, he wants to minimize the number of windows he opens inside his friend's mind.  Help him plan his path accordingly, so he ends up breaking the minimum number of windows!  Input Format: - First line contains a number t, denoting the number of test cases. - Every test case will have the following: - One line with two integers hm, wm - determining the width of the brain and the height of the brain.  The following characters define the state: - X is the space which cannot be penetrated filled by the memories of ex-girlfriends. - W is the windows which little Chandan need to cross to reach the goal. - . is an empty space in the brain. - G are the two goals to be rescued.  Output Format: 1. Minimum number of windows Chandan needs to open to get to both the goals in Arjit's mind.  Constraints: 1 <= t <= 100 2 <= hm, wm <= 100  There are EXACTLY two goals in his mind. For each goal, a path from the outside to that goal is surely going to exist. Chandan can move around freely outside the mind.

algorithm	0	Write an algorithm to create tables of a given set of players (i.e divide the players into groups) for a game in the following manner. Each table will have 6 players. Total number of players will be a multiple of 6. There are some conditions that must be fulfilled to decide which player takes which table. These conditions are defined later and requires some definitions that we will look into first.  'Distance' between the players: Since these players have been playing with each other in the past, we have history (available in a data set) about who played with whom in the past. Using this player game history we can plot a graph of players where each player is a node in the graph. A player is connected to another player if they have played on the same table in the past. In such a case distance between them is 1.   For example: If Pi and Pj have played on the same table in the past then they are connected with each other and 'Distance' between Pi and Pj is 1. Distance between any 2 players is defined as length of the shortest path between 2 players. If 2 players are not connected then distance between them is same as maximum of distance between any 2 players + 1  Degree of separation of a table Degree of separation of a table is defined as sum of (Distances of all players taken 2 at a time) Example: For a table of 6 players: Degree of separation = Sum of all 15 distances (6 choose 2)  The condition on table formation is: We have to create tables (i.e divide the players into groups) such that Sum of (degree of separation of all the tables) is minimum.  The constraints on data size: Number of history records is upto 100M records Number of unique players in history upto 200K Number of tables possible in the solution is upto 1K

algorithm	0	Design an object oriented console application named universe that reads in a file containing the schema of a two dimensional (2D) universe and outputs certain information about the universe. A 2D universe is a simplified universe that contains galaxies, stars, and planets, all of which are located on a flat plane specified using 2-coordinates (x-axis and y-axis).  There is only one universe and it contains one or more galaxies.  A galaxy may contain one or more stars located in it.  A star may contain zero or more planets located near it in the same galaxy.  A planet may belong to one or two stars located near it in the same galaxy (Planet E465D in the sample file below is an example).  In order to allow the objects to support more descriptive attributes and functionality in future revisions of the application, all the object types described above should be represented using separate classes. Parent-Child relationships should also be represented using links between the various object instances. The program will run with three arguments specified: the input-file, and the name of two objects of any type, A and B.  Example command-line: universe text.txt Alpha_Dra E465D Based on the command line arguments specified, the program will compute and display: 1. The parents location for both object A and B. (If needed, assume the coordinate of the universe is 0,0) 2. The minimum distance between object A (Alpha_Dra) and B (E465D). This is the distance between the two objects given locations. 3. Any of the two closest stars in the entire universe. 4. The farthest object from A, that is of the same type as A; and the farthest object from B, that is of the same type as B. (if one exists) The input file contains new-line separated lines each describing one object using the format:  Type|Unique-Name|X-Coordinate|Y-Coordinate|Parents-Name| Example test.txt input file: Galaxy|Draco|75434.2|89151.4|Universe| Star|Beta_And|23315.83|-2234.73|Andromeda| Star|Alpha_Dra|75243.25|84123|Draco| Galaxy|Andromeda|2967.78|-2357.2|Universe| Planet|P165EU|75242.42|84121.2|Alpha_Dra| Star|Alpha_And|26413.83|-2727.73|Andromeda| Planet|E465D|26412.4|-2726.51|Alpha_And| Planet|E465D|26412.4|-2726.51|Beta_And| Notes:  The Universe object that serves as a parent to the galaxies is implicit, and will not be explicitly defined in the input file.

algorithm	2	Description  A prospective CS student is investigating how many semesters it will take to graduate from a variety of different universities. Each university provides a list of required courses, their prerequisites, and when each course is offered. Given this information, determine the minimum number of semesters to graduate.  Consider the following example. A student is required to take 4 courses, mt42, cs123, cs456, and cs789. mt42 is only offered in the fall semester and has no prerequisites. Similarly, cs123 is only offered in the spring semester and has no prerequisites. cs456 is only offered in the spring semester and has both cs123 and mt42 as prerequisites. Finally, cs789 is offered in both fall and spring and has cs456 as its only prerequisite. The shortest time to graduate is 5 semesters, by taking mt42 in the fall, cs123 in the next spring, cs456 the following spring (since it is not offered in the fall) and finally cs789 the following fall.  For this problem, there are only two semesters, fall and spring. Always start counting semesters from the fall.  In addition to the fall/spring scheduling issues, there is one slight complication. In order to keep the dormitories full, each university limits the number of courses that can be taken in any semester. This limit appears as part of the input data. The third example below illustrates this issue.  Input  There are one to twenty-five data sets, followed by a final line containing only the integers -1 -1. A data set starts with a line containing two positive integers n, 1 <= n <= 12, which is the number of courses in this data set and m, 2 <= m <= 6, which is the maximum number of courses that can be taken in any single semester. The next line contains the n course identifiers. Each is a 1-5 character string from the set {a-z, 0-9}. Following the course identifiers is the individual course information. This consists of n lines, one line for each course, containing the course identifier, semester offered ('F'=Fall, 'S'=Spring, 'B'=Both semesters), the number of prerequisite courses, p, 0 <= p <= 5, and finally p prerequisite course identifiers. The first example data set below corresponds to the problem described above.  Output  The output contains one line for each data set, formatted as shown in the sample output.  Sample Input  4 6 cs123 mt42 cs456 cs789 mt42 F 0 cs123 S 0 cs456 S 2 cs123 mt42 cs789 B 1 cs456 3 6 math1 comp2 comp3 comp3 S 1 comp2 math1 S 0 comp2 F 1 math1 4 3 m10 m20 c33 c44 m10 B 0 m20 B 0 c33 B 0 c44 B 0 -1 -1 Sample Output  The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 5. The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 4. The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 2.

algorithm	1	In the game of Jack Straws, a number of plastic or wooden "straws" are dumped on the table and players try to remove them one-by-one without disturbing the other straws. In the question here, we are concerned with the following, related problem: First n straws are dumped on the table. Next, for every pair of straws, we want to determine if the straws are connected by a path of touching straws. In other words, given a list of the endpoints for n > 1 straws (as if they were dumped on a large piece of graph paper), determine all the pairs of straws that are connected. Note that touching is connecting, but also two straws can be connected indirectly via other connected straws. Give an algorithm to compute all the pairs of straws that are connected. Here is some additional information that you can use:   As a basic step you need to determine whether two straws directly touch (intersect), i.e., whether straw ab with end points a and b intersects with straw cd (with end points c and d). To get full credit also explain how the elementary step i) can be done. If you cannot find an algorithm for this step, assume an O(n 2 ) algorithm and explain how to find all pairs of straws that are connected. Analyse and explain the worst-case computational complexity of your algorithm in terms of n.
algorithm	0	Your job is to build a data structure to maintain a set of photographs. Your photograph database should allow you to insert and search for photographs, as well as to designate some of the photographs as favourites by marking them. In more detail, your data structure should support the following operations:  Insert(x, t, m): inserts photograph x that was taken at time t. If m = 1, then the photograph is marked as a favourite; if m = 0, then it is not a favourite.  Search(t): find the next photograph taken after time t.  NextFavorite(t): find the next photograph taken after time t that is a favourite.  Give a data structure for solving this problem, and explain how it works. For more efficiency, your data structure should be both time and space efficient: more points will be given for more efficient solutions. (Remember that the photographs themselves may be quite large.) Give the performance (i.e., running time) of each operation and the space usage of the data structure. You may assume that at any given time t, your camera has taken at most one photograph x. Describe your solution in words, or very high-level pseudocode. You do not need to provide complete details. You must provide enough detail, however, that your solution is clear.
algorithm	0	There is a zoo and there are several groups(number of groups:K) of people for tour. Each group is having different size (g1,g2,g3gK). There is one bus with capacity C. Journey starts from a point and bus will come back to the same point. A group can only be included in the bus if all the members of the groups can be accumulated in bus. After coming back from the tour, each group in the bus will again wait in the queue at the bus-stand. Bus-driver earns a rupee for each person travelled. You have to find the earning of the bus driver after R rounds.  For example :  Number of groups G = 4  Group size for each group : 2 4 3 5  Bus capacity : 7  Number of rounds R : 4    queue : (from front side) 2 4 3 5  First round : 2 4 (we cant take 3rd group as 3 members cant be accumulated after 2 and 4.)  queue : 3 5 2 4 (1st and 2nd group are enqueued. i.e. 2 and 4)  Second round : 3  queue : 5 2 4 3  Third Round : 5 2  queue : 4 3 5 2  Fourth Round : 4 3  After 4 rounds, total earning is 6+3+7+7 = 23.

algorithm	0	There is a n player game of cards. The deck of card is not fair, i.e. any card can be there any number of times. A card has a number and a color. Each player gets k card each (n and k can be harcoded in the solution). The computer starts the game by throwing a card from the deck of cards. Assume the card is 4 of Green. Then the other player has to throw either a 4 of any color or Green of any number. If the player does not have any such card, then it can say pass. The player who finishes all his card wins. The logic of selecting the card by the user can be hardcoded (Eg, If you use a list data structure for storing the cards for a player, then you can say that the player always throws the first card from the list). The logic was required only to start and conclude the game.

algorithm	0	In a Formula-1 challenge, there are n teams numbered 1 to n. Each team has a car and a driver. Cars specification are as follows:   Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour  Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.  Handling factor (hf) = 0.8  Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.  Here i is the team number. The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.  All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, youll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses nitro.  Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.

algorithm	0	Rahul is playing a very interesting game. He has some N different type of match boxes. All match boxes may have different number of matchsticks (S1, S2, S3... Sn).  Rahul chooses two random numbers F and K. K should be less than N. The game is that Rahul wants to select any K match boxes out of N match boxes such that total number of matchsticks in these K selected match boxes should be multiple of F. At the sametime Rahul wants that sum matchsticks of all the selected match boxes should be minimum possible.   Input Specifications: 1) Array S = {S1,S2,S3,...Sn} of size N corresponding to the number of match sticks in N matchboxes(0<=N<=1000} 2) F-Value (as explained above) 3) K-Value ( as explained above)  Output: 1 2 3 4 5 Here 3 is the number of matchsticks in matchbox I II III IV V minimum possible total number of matchsticks such that the conditioned explained in the problem statement is satisfied. Output -1 if it is not possible or invalid input.  For example, there are 5 match boxes i.e., N = 5 Let's say K is 3 (Rahul has to choose any 3 matchboxes)  Let's say F is 5(sum of matchsticks in 3 selected matchboxes should be multiple of 5). Rahul can choose II, III and V matchboxes which would give the total sum of 10 which is multiple of F i.e., 5. And 10 is the minimum possible matchsticks possible in the above case. So you have to answer the minimum possible matchstick(sum of the matchsticks in the selcted matchboxes) but the conditions given above should be satisfied.

algorithm	2	Problem Statement  Diameter  The diameter of a graph is the maximum shortest path between any two nodes.  At the beginning, there is a simple grpah contains exactly 1 node. Then we add new nodes one by one to the graph. Each time when we add a new node to the graph, we also add exactly one edge to connect this node to another node which already exists.  We want to find the diameter of the graph each time we add a new node. Note that each edge cost 1.  Input Format:  First line of the input contains one integer N, indicating how many new nodes we will add.  Then following N lines. The ith line contains an integer X, which means we add the ith node and an edge connecting the Xth node and ith node.  The original node is the 0th node.  Output Format:  Output N lines. The ith line is an integer indicating the diameter of the graph after adding the ith node.  Constraints:  0 < N <= 100000  0 <= Xi < i  i is counting from 1  Sample Input:  5  0  0  1  1  1  Sample Output:  1  2  3  3  3  Explanation:  Firstly the graph contains only node 0. The first line of output is 1 because the diameter becomes 1 when node 1 is added and connected to node 0. Diameter becomes 2 after adding node 2 to node 0. Then adding node 3, 4, 5, all of them are connecting to node 1, caculate the shortest path of all pairs of nodes, the maximum shortest path is 3, so the last 3 lines of output are all 3.

algorithm	0	A polygon is a piecewise-linear, closed curve in the plane. That is, it is a curve ending on itself that is formed by a sequence of straight-line segments, called the sides of the polygon. A point joining two consecutive sides is called a vertex of the polygon. If the polygon is simple, as we shall generally assume, it does not cross itself. The set of points in the plane enclosed by a simple polygon forms the interior of the polygon, the set of points on the polygon itself forms its boundary, and the set of points surrounding the polygon forms its exterior. A simple polygon is convex if, given any two points on its boundary or in its interior, all points on the line segment drawn between them are contained in the polygons boundary or interior. Professor Amundsen proposes the following method to determine whether a sequence hp0, p1, . . . , pn1i of n points forms the consecutive vertices of a convex polygon. Output yes if the set {6 pi pi+1 pi+2 : i = 0, 1, . . . , n  1}, where sub script addition is performed modulo n, does not contain both left turns and right turns; otherwise, output no. Show that although this method runs in linear time, it does not always produce the correct answer. Modify the professors method so that it always produces the correct answer in linear time.

algorithm	1	Amazon wants to implement a new backup system, in which files are stored into data tapes. This new system must follow the following 2 rules:   1. Never place more than two files on the same tape.   2. Files cannot be split across multiple tapes.   It's guaranteed that all tapes have the same size and that they will always be able to store the largest file.   Every time this process is executed, we already know the size of each file, and the capacity of the tapes. Having that in mind, we want to design a system that is able to count how many tapes will be required to store the backup in the most efficient way.   The parameter of your function will be a structure that will contain the file sizes and the capacity of the tapes. You must return the minimum amount of tapes required to store the files. Example: Input: Tape Size = 100; Files: 70, 10, 20 Output: 2

algorithm	0	You're the guard of a prison, you want to keep an eye on the most dangerous prisoner. Each prisoner has a danger rank of his own and a group of friends (prisoners, who also have danger ranks). The guard has a list of prisoners with their corresponding danger ranks and he also has a list of the friends of each of the prisoners in the prison.  The danger rank is computed as follows: Prisoner 1 has a danger value of 5, his friends are Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 5, who have danger values of 3 and 4 respectively. So the danger value of Prisoner 1 is 5+3+4 = 12.  There could be any number of prisoners. Whichever prisoner has the highest value is the most dangerous(computed using the above method).  Friendship can be assumed to be symmetric.  Come up with an efficient algorithm to find the most dangerous prisoner?  The solution I came up with runs in quadratic time.

algorithm	0	The latest reality show has hit the TV: Cat vs. Dog. In this show, a bunch of cats and dogs compete for the very prestigious Best Pet Ever title. In each episode, the cats and dogs get to show themselves off, after which the viewers vote on which pets should stay and which should be forced to leave the show. Each viewer gets to cast a vote on two things: one pet which should be kept on the show, and one pet which should be thrown out. Also, based on the universal fact that everyone is either a cat lover (i.e. a dog hater) or a dog lover (i.e. a cat hater), it has been decided that each vote must name exactly one cat and exactly one dog. Ingenious as they are, the producers have decided to use an advancement procedure which guarantees that as many viewers as possible will continue watching the show: the pets that get to stay will be chosen so as to maximize the number of viewers who get both their opinions satisfied. Write a program to calculate this maximum number of viewers.   Input  On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase: One line with three integers c, d, v (1  c, d  100 and 0  v  500): the number of cats, dogs, and voters.  v lines with two pet identifiers each. The first is the pet that this voter wants to keep, the second is the pet that this voter wants to throw out. A pet identifier starts with one of the characters C or D, indicating whether the pet is a cat or dog, respectively. The remaining part of the identifier is an integer giving the number of the pet (between 1 and c for cats, and between 1 and d for dogs). So for instance, D42 indicates dog number 42.  Output  Per testcase: One line with the maximum possible number of satisfied voters for the show.  Sample Input 1  2  1 1 2  C1 D1  D1 C1  1 2 4  C1 D1  C1 D1  C1 D2  D2 C1   Sample Output 1  1  3

algorithm	0	finds a domino pattern for a "double-N" domino set that forms a loop / a ring using all available tiles. for example,In a double-two domino set, with six tiles, (0 , 0) (0 , 1) (1 , 1) (1 , 2) (2 , 2) (2 , 0). So if parameter is 2, the function should return true. if no loop found, should return false.  Dominoes are small rectangular game tiles divided into two squares and embossed with dots on the top surface of the tile. You can think of dots as integers. A double-N domino set consists of (N+1)(N+2)/2 tiles, e.g. a standard double-six domino set has 28 tiles (T): one for each possible pair of values from (0.0) to (6.6) - no pair of numbers occurs more than once.

Examples: 1) Pattern : "abba", input: "redbluebluered" should return 1. 2) Pattern: "aaaa", input: "asdasdasdasd" should return 1. 3) Pattern: "aabb", input: "xyzabcxzyabc" should return 0.   I can think of a brute-force solution for this question where we add the character in the pattern and n length of the string to a hashmap and recurse over the pattern array and string. But is there anything more efficient? This was a pretty difficult question in my opinion.
algorithm	0	Implement algo for ls command in unix. You have n ordered file names with you. You have to print file names in column then in rows.   e.g. I have 5 files F1 F3 F5 F2 F4  Minimize on number of rows Maximize on number of columns  Max Page Width possible P Page width of any row = max width of all files in first column + max width of all files in second column + ... +max width of all files in last column
algorithm	0	You have a set of N objects. Each of these objects have certain properties associated with them. A property is represented by a (key, value) pair. For example, assume you have the following two objects. Tower: {  (height, 100), (weight, 50),  (xposition, 25), (yposition, 36) } Tree: {  (area, 100), (noofleaves, 500),  (height, 25), (yposition, 36) } Each object you have, will have at most 4 properties. An object will have at least 1 property. Note, from the two objects above, that it is not necessary for key in the properties to be same for all the objects. Also, it is not necessary for the key to be different. Now, given N such objects, you wish to answer M queries. Each query is represented by a set of properties (again, at most 4 properties, and at least 1 property). The answer for the query is the number of objects in the set, that have all the given properties. Two properties are considered equal iff both the key and the value match. For example, if you have the above two objects, then the answer for the following queries is Query: { (height, 100), (yposition, 36) } Answer: 1 // matches Tower, but not Tree Query: { (yposition, 36) } Answer: 2 // matches both Tower and Tree Query: { (height, 100), (noofleaves, 500) } Answer: 0 // neither Tower, not Tree satisfy both properties Input The first line of input contains N and M. This is followed by the description of the N objects. The description of the i-th object will start by a number k, which is the number of properties associated with the object. The next k lines contain two space separated strings - the property key and the property value. Note that the property value is not necessarily an integer (although this is so for the example above). This is followed by the description of M queries. The format of a query will be exactly same to that of the objects. Check the Sample Input for clarification. One test file will contain only one test case. A single test case may contain several queries. Output Print M lines. Each line must be the answer of the respective query. Constraints 1  N  10000  1  M  100000  1  k  4 Sample Input 2 3 4 height 100a weight 50b xposition 25a yposition 36b 4 area 100a noofleaves 500 height 25 yposition 36b 3 weight 80 xposition 25a yposition 36b 1 yposition 36b 2 xposition 25a yposition 36b Sample Output 0 2 1

algorithm	0	A seller sells lot of products in his store and people place orders,just like any other store. Each item has a different weight and price.  And each order can be a combination of different number of items with random quantity. Now each of these orders areto be put into different packages and sent to the courier company for delivery.  But there are certain rules while splitting items into packages, they are as below:  1. If the cost of all the items in an order is more than $1000, split those items into multiple packages, otherwise one package would be enough.  2. If the items in the same order are split into multiple packages, then the weight of the  packages should be equally distributed over the packages with consideration of optimum courier charges.  3. While splitting, NO PACKAGE can have a total price above $1000

algorithm	1	There is a string whose characters can only be either a, b or _ (there can be only one _ in the string). At each step, we can modify the string as follows: 1. _ can be swapped with its adjacent character, example a_ba can be changed to either _aba or ab_a. 2. Two characters adjacent to _ (both on the same side of _) can be reversed along with the _ if both characters are different, example, aa_ba can be changed to aaab_ but not to _aaba because both characters are a. You are given two strings, the initial state and the final state (lengths will be same), you have to output the minimum number of steps required to change the string in initial state to the string in the final state. example: input: a_b ab_ output: 1 input: abaa_a b_aaaa output: 4 reason for example 2:- abaa_a -> aba_aa -> ab_aaa -> _baaaa -> b_aaaa

algorithm	0	t's laundry day, and, as usual, you've been putting this off for quite some time. Also, unfortunately, you lacked the foresight to actually ensure all your dirty laundry stayed in your hamper whilst it accumulated (what? we can't ALL be underwear basketball pros!).  Begrudgingly, you've gathered up all the clothing you could find and sent them through the wash. Now you have a disheveled pile of clean, albiet disorganized, accoutrements. You come to the realization that you probably lost some items in the fray, so now it's time to fold and figure out what's gone missing!  To get a good idea of the state of your wardrobe, count up the number of distinct shirts, pants, and underwear you have as you go through the laundry. Also pair up your socks, noting the number of pairs of each kind of sock and if there are any lonely souls (single (and ready to mingle) socks).   Input Specifications  Each article of clothing will have its own separate line. You have a penchant for hoarding, so there is no guarantee as to the number of pieces, but you can assure yourself that each article can be easily categorized by description (name).  Articles of clothing will be fed in as line-delimited list. See below for examples.   Output Specifications  Output should be an alphabetically (case-insensitive) sorted, line-delimited list of the articles of clothing along with their count. Each field (count, category) should be separated by a pipe (|). If you come across a sock without a soulmate, the count should be designated by a 0 (zero). Socks that are in pairs should be on separate lines from the socks of the same category without pairs, and should come before the pairless sock. See below for examples.  Sample Input/Output  INPUT white shirt polka dot sock  red sock  superhero shirt  torn jeans  polka dot sock  white shirt  polka dot sock   OUTPUT 1|polka dot sock 0|polka dot sock 0|red sock 1|superhero shirt 1|torn jeans 2|white shirt  EXPLANATION As described above in the input and output specifications.

algorithm	1	Asked at Walmart Labs ---------------------------------- There is a row of seats. Assume that it contains 15 seats adjacent to each other. There is a group of people who are already seating in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together & some are scattered.  Take the row as a String in java.  The seat which is occupied is marked with a character 'X' & which is not occupied is marked with a dot '.'   Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other and without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps at the end of the grouping them together should be minimum.  Ok let me try to explain you in details.  Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) -                 . . . . x . . x x . . . x . .   Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -   . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .    Following are the steps to achieve this -            1 - Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index -   Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2            2 - Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index - Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------           So now the total number of jumps made = ( 2 + 3) = 5 which is the minimum possible jumps to make them seat together.  There are also other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 & that will not be minimum.  For example bring them all towards the starting of the row i.e. start placing them from index 0. In that case the total number of jumps will be ( 4 + 6 + 6 + 9 ) = 25 which is very costly and not an optimized way to do this movement.  Now write an algorithm which will return the minimum number of jumps required to make them sit together.

algorithm	0	You are driving a bus along a highway, full of rowdy, hyper, thirsty students and a soda fountain machine. Each minute that a student is on your bus, that student drinks one ounce of soda. Your goal is to drop the students off quickly, so that the total amount of soda consumed by all students is as small as possible.  You know how many students will get off of the bus at each exit. Your bus begins somewhere along the highway (probably not at either end) and move s at a constant speed of 37.4 miles per hour. You must drive the bus along the highway; however, you may drive forward to one exit then backward to an exit in the opposite direction, switching as often as you like. (You can stop the bus, drop off students, and turn around instantaneously.)  Describe an efficient algorithm to drop the students off so that they drink as little soda as possible. Your input consists of the bus route (a list of the exits, together with the travel time between successive exits), the number of students you will drop off at each exit, and the current location of your bus (which you may assume is an exit).

Each computer accepts connections at certain incoming port numbers and can make outgoing connections to a possibly different set of outgoing port numbers. Some computers are connected through cables to each other. Computer A can directly transmit data to computer B if and only if: there is a direct cable connection between computer A and B, there exists a port number X, that is an outgoing port on computer A and an incoming port on computer B. Some of the computers are connected directly to the outside, unsafe network. If there is a way to connect to computer Z either directly or indirecly from the outside network, that computer Z is "at risk". If there is no way to connect to computer Z from outside network, that computer is "safe".

trees-and-graphs	1	One of the many ways of representing a tree is to have an array(of length same as number of nodes), where each element in the node denotes the parent of that node.             Eg - {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1} would represent a tree with - * 0 as root * 1 and 2 as children of 0 * 3 and 4 as children of 1  Given a similar representation, you have to print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree.  Level order traversal of a tree is where we traverse levels of tree one by one.  Eg - For the above given tree, level order traversal would be - 0 1 2 3 4 And hence, the reverse level order traversal is - 3 4 1 2 0 Please note - * An element with parent = -1 is the root element. * An element with the least index becomes the left most child. (ie. a node with always be on left of all its siblings that have higher index than it) * When printing a level of tree you need to maintain left to right order.  Input Format - First line of the input contains number of nodes in the tree (N) Next line contains N (space seperated) numbers that denote where i-th number will denote the parent node of i-th node.  Output Format - Print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree, with every new level starting in a different line. Notes/Limits - * 1 <= N <= 50 * There will be only one root element in any given test case * Given numbers will always form a valid undivided tree * Output should be in the exact format as specified (including whitespaces) Sample Test Cases -     Input - 5 -1 0 0 2 1 Output - 4 3 1 2 0  Input - 9 8 7 0 5 5 8 7 0 -1 Output - 1 6 2 7 3 4 0 5 8 Input - 45 24 42 4 30 29 43 22 15 26 36 26 16 3 22 21 41 18 16 34 41 12 29 32 30 43 15 4 38 36 -1 24 42 18 6 21 38 6 17 32 17 3 34 12 14 14 Output - 1 31 20 42 9 28 12 40 33 36 3 23 37 39 6 13 27 35  0 30 11 17 22 38 7 25 5 24 16 32 15 19 8 10 43 44 18 41 2 26 14 34 4 21 29  Input - 33 17 25 0 14 7 2 5 25 18 8 16 27 10 9 19 7 31 31 19 0 8 14 9 17 18 2 30 16 30 10 5 -1 27 Output - 13 22 26 28 4 15 9 20 6 30 1 7 3 21 8 24 5 25 14 18 12 29 11 32 2 19 10 27 0 23 16 17 31

trees-and-graphs	0	lunatic server solution is monitoring the wrong file entry in the server. so company made another a problem for it to monitor AVL tree violation. The problem should be solved in java... problem states that...   This problem requires you to monitor a tree for violation of the AVL balance criteria as the tree is being constructed. The input to the program consists of a sequence of numbers. As you read in each number, check where the node is going to be inserted into the current tree. [At the start, the tree is empty.] If that insertion can cause the balance of any of the nodes in the tree to go beyond what is allowed by the AVL criteria, DO NOT add the number into the tree. Instead, print out the number into the standard output. Numbers which retain the AVL property of the tree should be added to the tree at the appropriate place as per the method discussed in class. Continue with the remaining numbers. Please note that you do not have to do any balancing of the tree! The input is terminated by 1. The output from the program consists of the numbers rejected by the program. At the end, you should also print out the count of such numbers rejected. Hint: It would help to keep the height of the left and right subtrees of each node along with the node. Also note that the process of checking for violation and actually inserting are quite similar; in the former case you do not update anything but do everything else. This observation can be used to write the code. Sample Input/Output Input 3 5 1 6 2 4 9 7 -1 Output 7 1 (This means rejected key(s) are: key 7, totally 1 rejected key)

hash-table	0	Explain how hashtables work internally. How is hashcode generated and what wiill happen to hash code when 2 values are same.
hash-table	0	Consider a hash table of size N, numbered 0 to N-1. You have to insert integers into this table using the hashing technique given below: Let i be the integer to be inserted. Compute the index j of the location where the insertion is to be made as j = i mod N. If this location is empty then put the element at this position else recompute the next location as follows: Remove the right most digit of i. Using the new value of i, recompute j = i mod N. If the digit removed was odd, then move j locations forward from the current location else move j locations backward from the current location (assume 0 as even). Note that this move will wrap around both the edges of the table. Keep doing this till you either find a free location or all the digits of i have been removed. When i comes to only one digit, and its rightmost digit is removed, the number remaining is zero - therefore, this will lead to a zero-step move. If all digits of i have been removed and yet unable to find a free location, from the last location tried, start moving in the direction corresponding to the last digit removed. Keep moving till you detect a free location. Assume that the number of integers inserted is not more than the table size. Input Specification The first line will contain just one integer. This will give the table size, N. On the next line will be the list of positive integers that need to be inserted into the table. The integers will be separated by a space each, and the last integer will be -1 indicating end of input. (-1 is not to be inserted into the table). Output Specification The output should contain, for each integer, the locations that were checked while inserting that integer (including the location in which the integer was finally inserted). The locations checked for each of the integers should be output on a line by itself, separated by one space each, each line being terminated by a new line. Sample Input/Output Input 7 38 52 145 16 179 4 -1 Output 3 3   5 5   5 4 2 4   0 4   4 3 2 1
hash-table	0	Q: Given a collection of records which have fields like first name, last name, describe how would you store them in a hash table. Each object passed is to be stored in the hash table and the key has to be returned for subsequent retrieval.
